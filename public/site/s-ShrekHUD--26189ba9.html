<br />
                                     SHREK<br />
                         Once upon a time there was a lovely <br />
                         princess. But she had an enchantment <br />
                         upon her of a fearful sort which could <br />
                         only be broken by love's first kiss. <br />
                         She was locked away in a castle guarded <br />
                         by a terrible fire-breathing dragon. <br />
                         Many brave knights had attempted to <br />
                         free her from this dreadful prison, <br />
                         but non prevailed. She waited in the <br />
                         dragon's keep in the highest room of <br />
                         the tallest tower for her true love <br />
                         and true love's first kiss. (laughs) <br />
                         Like that's ever gonna happen. What <br />
                         a load of - (toilet flush)<br />
 <br />
               Allstar - by Smashmouth begins to play. Shrek goes about his <br />
               day. While in a nearby town, the villagers get together to go <br />
               after the ogre.<br />
 <br />
               NIGHT - NEAR SHREK'S HOME<br />
<br />
                                     MAN1<br />
                         Think it's in there?<br />
<br />
                                     MAN2<br />
                         All right. Let's get it!<br />
<br />
                                     MAN1<br />
                         Whoa. Hold on. Do you know what that <br />
                         thing can do to you?<br />
 <br />
                                     MAN3<br />
                         Yeah, it'll grind your bones for it's <br />
                         bread.<br />
 <br />
               Shrek sneaks up behind them and laughs.<br />
<br />
                                     SHREK<br />
                         Yes, well, actually, that would be a <br />
                         giant. Now, ogres, oh they're much worse. <br />
                         They'll make a suit from your freshly <br />
                         peeled skin.<br />
 <br />
                                     MEN<br />
                         No!<br />
<br />
                                     SHREK<br />
                         They'll shave your liver. Squeeze the <br />
                         jelly from your eyes! Actually, it's <br />
                         quite good on toast.<br />
 <br />
                                     MAN1<br />
                         Back! Back, beast! Back! I warn ya! <br />
                         (waves the torch at Shrek.)<br />
 <br />
               Shrek calmly licks his fingers and extinguishes the torch. The <br />
               men shrink back away from him. Shrek roars very loudly and long <br />
               and his breath extinguishes all the remaining torches until the <br />
               men are in the dark.<br />
 <br />
                                     SHREK<br />
                         This is the part where you run away. <br />
                         (The men scramble to get away. He laughs.) <br />
                         And stay out! (looks down and picks <br />
                         up a piece of paper. Reads.) "Wanted. <br />
                         Fairy tale creatures."(He sighs and <br />
                         throws the paper over his shoulder.)<br />
 <br />
                         <br />
               THE NEXT DAY<br />
<br />
               There is a line of fairy tale creatures. The head of the guard <br />
               sits at a table paying people for bringing the fairy tale creatures <br />
               to him. There are cages all around. Some of the people in line <br />
               are Peter Pan, who is carrying Tinkerbell in a cage, Gipetto <br />
               who's carrying Pinocchio, and a farmer who is carrying the three <br />
               little pigs.<br />
 <br />
                                     GUARD<br />
                         All right. This one's full. Take it <br />
                         away! Move it along. Come on! Get up!<br />
 <br />
                         <br />
                                     HEAD GUARD<br />
                         Next!<br />
<br />
                                     GUARD<br />
                         (taking the witch's broom) Give me that! <br />
                         Your flying days are over. (breaks the <br />
                         broom in half)<br />
 <br />
                                     HEAD GUARD<br />
                         That's 20 pieces of silver for the witch. <br />
                         Next!<br />
 <br />
                                     GUARD<br />
                         Get up! Come on!<br />
<br />
                                     HEAD GUARD<br />
                         Twenty pieces.<br />
<br />
                                     LITTLE BEAR<br />
                         (crying) This cage is too small.<br />
<br />
                                     DONKEY<br />
                         Please, don't turn me in. I'll never <br />
                         be stubborn again. I can change. Please! <br />
                         Give me another chance!<br />
 <br />
                                     OLD WOMAN<br />
                         Oh, shut up. (jerks his rope)<br />
<br />
                                     DONKEY<br />
                         Oh!<br />
<br />
                                     HEAD GUARD<br />
                         Next! What have you got?<br />
<br />
                                     GIPETTO<br />
                         This little wooden puppet.<br />
<br />
                                     PINOCCHIO<br />
                         I'm not a puppet. I'm a real boy. (his <br />
                         nose grows)<br />
 <br />
                                     HEAD GUARD<br />
                         Five shillings for the possessed toy. <br />
                         Take it away.<br />
 <br />
                                     PINOCCHIO<br />
                         Father, please! Don't let them do this! <br />
                         Help me!<br />
 <br />
               Gipetto takes the money and walks off. The old woman steps up <br />
               to the table.<br />
 <br />
                                     HEAD GUARD<br />
                         Next! What have you got?<br />
<br />
                                     OLD WOMAN<br />
                         Well, I've got a talking donkey.<br />
<br />
                                     HEAD GUARD<br />
                         Right. Well, that's good for ten shillings, <br />
                         if you can prove it.<br />
 <br />
                                     OLD WOMAN<br />
                         Oh, go ahead, little fella.<br />
<br />
               Donkey just looks up at her.<br />
<br />
                                     HEAD GUARD<br />
                         Well?<br />
<br />
                                     OLD WOMAN<br />
                         Oh, oh, he's just...he's just a little <br />
                         nervous. He's really quite a chatterbox. <br />
                         Talk, you boneheaded dolt...<br />
 <br />
                                     HEAD GUARD<br />
                         That's it. I've heard enough. Guards!<br />
 <br />
                         <br />
                                     OLD WOMAN<br />
                         No, no, he talks! He does. (pretends <br />
                         to be Donkey) I can talk. I love to <br />
                         talk. I'm the talkingest damn thing <br />
                         you ever saw.<br />
 <br />
                                     HEAD GUARD<br />
                         Get her out of my sight.<br />
<br />
                                     OLD WOMAN<br />
                         No, no! I swear! Oh! He can talk!<br />
<br />
               The guards grab the old woman and she struggles with them. One <br />
               of her legs flies out and kicks Tinkerbell out of Peter Pan's <br />
               hands, and her cage drops on Donkey's head. He gets sprinkled <br />
               with fairy dust and he's able to fly.<br />
 <br />
                                     DONKEY<br />
                         Hey! I can fly!<br />
<br />
                                     PETER PAN<br />
                         He can fly!<br />
<br />
                                     3 LITTLE PIGS<br />
                         He can fly!<br />
<br />
                                     HEAD GUARD<br />
                         He can talk!<br />
<br />
                                     DONKEY<br />
                         Ha, ha! That's right, fool! Now I'm <br />
                         a flying, talking donkey. You might <br />
                         have seen a housefly, maybe even a superfly <br />
                         but I bet you ain't never seen a donkey <br />
                         fly. Ha, ha! (the pixie dust begins <br />
                         to wear off) Uh-oh. (he begins to sink <br />
                         to the ground.)<br />
 <br />
               He hits the ground with a thud.<br />
<br />
                                     HEAD GUARD<br />
                         Seize him! (Donkey takes of running.) <br />
                         After him!<br />
 <br />
                                     GUARDS<br />
                         He's getting away! Get him! This way! <br />
                         Turn!<br />
 <br />
               Donkey keeps running and he eventually runs into Shrek. Literally. <br />
               Shrek turns around to see who bumped into him. Donkey looks scared <br />
               for a moment then he spots the guards coming up the path. He <br />
               quickly hides behind Shrek.<br />
 <br />
                                     HEAD GUARD<br />
                         You there. Ogre!<br />
<br />
                                     SHREK<br />
                         Aye?<br />
<br />
                                     HEAD GUARD<br />
                         By the order of Lord Farquaad I am authorized <br />
                         to place you both under arrest and transport <br />
                         you to a designated resettlement facility.<br />
 <br />
                         <br />
                                     SHREK<br />
                         Oh, really? You and what army?<br />
<br />
               He looks behind the guard and the guard turns to look as well <br />
               and we see that the other men have run off. The guard tucks tail <br />
               and runs off. Shrek laughs and goes back about his business and <br />
               begins walking back to his cottage.<br />
 <br />
                                     DONKEY<br />
                         Can I say something to you? Listen, <br />
                         you was really, really, really somethin' <br />
                         back here. Incredible!<br />
 <br />
                                     SHREK<br />
                         Are you talkin' to...(he turns around <br />
                         and Donkey is gone) me? (he turns back <br />
                         around and Donkey is right in front <br />
                         of him.) Whoa!<br />
 <br />
                                     DONKEY<br />
                         Yes. I was talkin' to you. Can I tell <br />
                         you that you that you was great back <br />
                         here? Those guards! They thought they <br />
                         was all of that. Then you showed up, <br />
                         and bam! They was trippin' over themselves <br />
                         like babes in the woods. That really <br />
                         made me feel good to see that.<br />
 <br />
                                     SHREK<br />
                         Oh, that's great. Really.<br />
<br />
                                     DONKEY<br />
                         Man, it's good to be free.<br />
<br />
                                     SHREK<br />
                         Now, why don't you go celebrate your <br />
                         freedom with your own friends? Hmm?<br />
 <br />
                         <br />
                                     DONKEY<br />
                         But, uh, I don't have any friends. And <br />
                         I'm not goin' out there by myself. Hey, <br />
                         wait a minute! I got a great idea! I'll <br />
                         stick with you. You're mean, green, <br />
                         fightin' machine. Together we'll scare <br />
                         the spit out of anybody that crosses <br />
                         us.<br />
 <br />
               Shrek turns and regards Donkey for a moment before roaring very <br />
               loudly.<br />
 <br />
                                     DONKEY<br />
                         Oh, wow! That was really scary. If you <br />
                         don't mind me sayin', if that don't <br />
                         work, your breath certainly will get <br />
                         the job done, 'cause you definitely <br />
                         need some Tic Tacs or something, 'cause <br />
                         you breath stinks! You almost burned <br />
                         the hair outta my nose, just like the <br />
                         time...(Shrek covers his mouth but Donkey <br />
                         continues to talk, so Shrek removes <br />
                         his hand.) ...then I ate some rotten <br />
                         berries. I had strong gases leaking <br />
                         out of my butt that day.<br />

                                     SHREK<br />
                         Why are you following me?<br />
<br />
                                     DONKEY<br />
                         I'll tell you why. (singing) 'Cause <br />
                         I'm all alone, There's no one here beside <br />
                         me, My problems have all gone, There's <br />
                         no one to deride me, But you gotta have <br />
                         faith...<br />
 <br />
                                     SHREK<br />
                         Stop singing! It's no wonder you don't <br />
                         have any friends.<br />
 <br />
                                     DONKEY<br />
                         Wow. Only a true friend would be that <br />
                         cruelly honest.<br />
 <br />
                                     SHREK<br />
                         Listen, little donkey. Take a look at <br />
                         me. What am I?<br />
 <br />
                                     DONKEY<br />
                         (looks all the way up at Shrek) Uh ...really <br />
                         tall?<br />
 <br />
                                     SHREK<br />
                         No! I'm an ogre! You know. "Grab your <br />
                         torch and pitchforks." Doesn't that <br />
                         bother you?<br />
 <br />
                                     DONKEY<br />
                         Nope.<br />
<br />
                                     SHREK<br />
                         Really?<br />
<br />
                                     DONKEY<br />
                         Really, really.<br />
<br />
                                     SHREK<br />
                         Oh.<br />
<br />
                                     DONKEY<br />
                         Man, I like you. What's you name?<br />
<br />
                                     SHREK<br />
                         Uh, Shrek.<br />
<br />
                                     DONKEY<br />
                         Shrek? Well, you know what I like about <br />
                         you, Shrek? You got that kind of I-don't-care-what-nobody-thinks-of-me <br />
                         thing. I like that. I respect that, <br />
                         Shrek. You all right. (They come over <br />
                         a hill and you can see Shrek's cottage.) <br />
                         Whoa! Look at that. Who'd want to live <br />
                         in place like that?<br />
 <br />
                                     SHREK<br />
                         That would be my home.<br />
<br />
                                     DONKEY<br />
                         Oh! And it is lovely! Just beautiful. <br />
                         You know you are quite a decorator. <br />
                         It's amazing what you've done with such <br />
                         a modest budget. I like that boulder. <br />
                         That is a nice boulder. I guess you <br />
                         don't entertain much, do you?<br />
 <br />
                                     SHREK<br />
                         I like my privacy.<br />
<br />
                                     DONKEY<br />
                         You know, I do too. That's another thing <br />
                         we have in common. Like I hate it when <br />
                         you got somebody in your face. You've <br />
                         trying to give them a hint, and they <br />
                         won't leave. There's that awkward silence. <br />
                         (awkward silence) Can I stay with you?<br />
 <br />
                         <br />
                                     SHREK<br />
                         Uh, what?<br />
<br />
                                     DONKEY<br />
                         Can I stay with you, please?<br />
<br />
                                     SHREK<br />
                         (sarcastically) Of course!<br />
<br />
                                     DONKEY<br />
                         Really?<br />
<br />
                                     SHREK<br />
                         No.<br />
<br />
                                     DONKEY<br />
                         Please! I don't wanna go back there! <br />
                         You don't know what it's like to be <br />
                         considered a freak. (pause while he <br />
                         looks at Shrek) Well, maybe you do. <br />
                         But that's why we gotta stick together. <br />
                         You gotta let me stay! Please! Please!<br />
 <br />
                         <br />
                                     SHREK<br />
                         Okay! Okay! But one night only.<br />
<br />
                                     DONKEY<br />
                         Ah! Thank you! (he runs inside the cottage)<br />
 <br />
                         <br />
                                     SHREK<br />
                         What are you...? (Donkey hops up onto <br />
                         a chair.) No! No!<br />
 <br />
                                     DONKEY<br />
                         This is gonna be fun! We can stay up <br />
                         late, swappin' manly stories, and in <br />
                         the mornin' I'm makin' waffles.<br />
 <br />
                                     SHREK<br />
                         Oh!<br />
<br />
                                     DONKEY<br />
                         Where do, uh, I sleep?<br />
<br />
                                     SHREK<br />
                         (irritated) Outside!<br />
<br />
                                     DONKEY<br />
                         Oh, well, I guess that's cool. I mean, <br />
                         I don't know you, and you don't know <br />
                         me, so I guess outside is best, you <br />
                         know. Here I go. Good night. (Shrek <br />
                         slams the door.) (sigh) I mean, I do <br />
                         like the outdoors. I'm a donkey. I was <br />
                         born outside. I'll just be sitting by <br />
                         myself outside, I guess, you know. By <br />
                         myself, outside. I'm all alone...there's <br />
                         no one here beside me...<br />
 <br />
               SHREK'S COTTAGE - NIGHT<br />
<br />
               Shrek is getting ready for dinner. He sits himself down and lights <br />
               a candle made out of earwax. He begins to eat when he hears a <br />
               noise. He stands up with a huff.<br />
 <br />
                                     SHREK<br />
                         (to Donkey) I thought I told you to <br />
                         stay outside.<br />
 <br />
                                     DONKEY<br />
                         (from the window) I am outside.<br />
<br />
               There is another noise and Shrek turns to find the person that <br />
               made the noise. He sees several shadows moving. He finally turns <br />
               and spots 3 blind mice on his table.<br />
 <br />
                                     BLIND MOUSE1<br />
                         Well, gents, it's a far cry from the <br />
                         farm, but what choice do we have?<br />
 <br />
                         <br />
                                     BLIND MOUSE2<br />
                         It's not home, but it'll do just fine.<br />
 <br />
                         <br />
                                     GORDO<br />
                         (bouncing on a slug) What a lovely bed.<br />
 <br />
                         <br />
                                     SHREK<br />
                         Got ya. (Grabs a mouse, but it escapes <br />
                         and lands on his shoulder.)<br />
 <br />
                                     GORDO<br />
                         I found some cheese. (bites Shrek's <br />
                         ear)<br />
 <br />
                                     SHREK<br />
                         Ow!<br />
<br />
                                     GORDO<br />
                         Blah! Awful stuff.<br />
<br />
                                     BLIND MOUSE1<br />
                         Is that you, Gordo?<br />
<br />
                                     GORDO<br />
                         How did you know?<br />
<br />
                                     SHREK<br />
                         Enough! (he grabs the 3 mice) What are <br />
                         you doing in my house? (He gets bumped <br />
                         from behind and he drops the mice.) <br />
                         Hey! (he turns and sees the Seven Dwarves <br />
                         with Snow White on the table.) Oh, no, <br />
                         no, no. Dead broad off the table.<br />
 <br />
                         <br />
                                     DWARF<br />
                         Where are we supposed to put her? The <br />
                         bed's taken.<br />
 <br />
                                     SHREK<br />
                         Huh?<br />
<br />
               Shrek marches over to the bedroom and throws back the curtain. <br />
               The Big Bad Wolf is sitting in the bed. The wolf just looks at <br />
               him.<br />
 <br />
                                     BIG BAD WOLF<br />
                         What?<br />
<br />
               TIME LAPSE<br />
<br />
               Shrek now has the Big Bad Wolf by the collar and is dragging <br />
               him to the front door.<br />
 <br />
                                     SHREK<br />
                         I live in a swamp. I put up signs. I'm <br />
                         a terrifying ogre! What do I have to <br />
                         do get a little privacy? (He opens the <br />
                         front door to throw the Wolf out and <br />
                         he sees that all the collected Fairy <br />
                         Tale Creatures are on his land.) Oh, <br />
                         no. No! No!<br />
 <br />
               The 3 bears sit around the fire, the pied piper is playing his <br />
               pipe and the rats are all running to him, some elves are directing <br />
               flight traffic so that the fairies and witches can land...etc.<br />
 <br />
               <br />
                                     SHREK<br />
                         What are you doing in my swamp? (this <br />
                         echoes and everyone falls silent.)<br />
 <br />
                         <br />
               Gasps are heard all around. The 3 good fairies hide inside a <br />
               tent.<br />
 <br />
                                     SHREK<br />
                         All right, get out of here. All of you, <br />
                         move it! Come on! Let's go! Hapaya! <br />
                         Hapaya! Hey! Quickly. Come on! (more <br />
                         dwarves run inside the house) No, no! <br />
                         No, no. Not there. Not there. (they <br />
                         shut the door on him) Oh! (turns to <br />
                         look at Donkey)<br />
 <br />
                                     DONKEY<br />
                         Hey, don't look at me. I didn't invite <br />
                         them.<br />
 <br />
                                     PINOCCHIO<br />
                         Oh, gosh, no one invited us.<br />
<br />
                                     SHREK<br />
                         What?<br />
<br />
                                     PINOCCHIO<br />
                         We were forced to come here.<br />
<br />
                                     SHREK<br />
                         (flabbergasted) By who?<br />
<br />
                                     LITTLE PIG<br />
                         Lord Farquaad. He huffed and he puffed <br />
                         and he...signed an eviction notice.<br />
 <br />
                         <br />
                                     SHREK<br />
                         (heavy sigh) All right. Who knows where <br />
                         this Farquaad guy is?<br />
 <br />
               Everyone looks around at each other but no one answers.<br />
<br />
                                     DONKEY<br />
                         Oh, I do. I know where he is.<br />
<br />
                                     SHREK<br />
                         Does anyone else know where to find <br />
                         him? Anyone at all?<br />
 <br />
                                     DONKEY<br />
                         Me! Me!<br />
<br />
                                     SHREK<br />
                         Anyone?<br />
<br />
                                     DONKEY<br />
                         Oh! Oh, pick me! Oh, I know! I know! <br />
                         Me, me!<br />
 <br />
                                     SHREK<br />
                         (sigh) Okay, fine. Attention, all fairy <br />
                         tale things. Do not get comfortable. <br />
                         Your welcome is officially worn out. <br />
                         In fact, I'm gonna see this guy Farquaad <br />
                         right now and get you all off my land <br />
                         and back where you came from! (Pause. <br />
                         Then the crowd goes wild.) Oh! (to Donkey) <br />
                         You! You're comin' with me.<br />
 <br />
                                     DONKEY<br />
                         All right, that's what I like to hear, <br />
                         man. Shrek and Donkey, two stalwart <br />
                         friends, off on a whirlwind big-city <br />
                         adventure. I love it!<br />
 <br />
                                     DONKEY<br />
                         (singing) On the road again. Sing it <br />
                         with me, Shrek. I can't wait to get <br />
                         on the road again.<br />
 <br />
                                     SHREK<br />
                         What did I say about singing?<br />
<br />
                                     DONKEY<br />
                         Can I whistle?<br />
<br />
                                     SHREK<br />
                         No.<br />
<br />
                                     DONKEY<br />
                         Can I hum it?<br />
<br />
                                     SHREK<br />
                         All right, hum it.<br />
<br />
               Donkey begins to hum 'On the Road Again'.<br />
<br />
               DULOC - KITCHEN<br />
<br />
               A masked man is torturing the Gingerbread Man. He's continually <br />
               dunking him in a glass of milk. Lord Farquaad walks in.<br />
 <br />
                                     FARQUAAD<br />
                         That's enough. He's ready to talk.<br />
 <br />
                         <br />
               The Gingerbread Man is pulled out of the milk and slammed down <br />
               onto a cookie sheet. Farquaad laughs as he walks over to the <br />
               table. However when he reaches the table we see that it goes <br />
               up to his eyes. He clears his throat and the table is lowered<br />
                                     FIONA<br />
                         Well, yes.<br />
<br />
               Both Donkey and Shrek burst out laughing.<br />
<br />
                                     DONKEY<br />
                         You think Shrek is your true love!<br />
 <br />
                         <br />
                                     FIONA<br />
                         What is so funny?<br />
<br />
                                     SHREK<br />
                         Let's just say I'm not your type, okay?Fiona: <br />
                         Of course, you are. You're my rescuer. <br />
                         Now - - Now remove your helmet.<br />
 <br />
                                     SHREK<br />
                         Look. I really don't think this is a <br />
                         good idea.<br />
 <br />
                                     FIONA<br />
                         Just take off the helmet.<br />
<br />
                                     SHREK<br />
                         I'm not going to.<br />
<br />
                                     FIONA<br />
                         Take it off.<br />
<br />
                                     SHREK<br />
                         No!<br />
<br />
                                     FIONA<br />
                         Now!<br />
<br />
                                     SHREK<br />
                         Okay! Easy. As you command. Your Highness. <br />
                         (takes off his helmet)<br />
 <br />
                                     FIONA<br />
                         You- - You're a- - an ogre.<br />
<br />
                                     SHREK<br />
                         Oh, you were expecting Prince Charming.<br />
 <br />
                         <br />
                                     FIONA<br />
                         Well, yes, actually. Oh, no. This is <br />
                         all wrong. You're not supposed to be <br />
                         an ogre.<br />
 <br />
                                     SHREK<br />
                         Princess, I was sent to rescue you by <br />
                         Lord Farquaad, okay? He is the one who <br />
                         wants to marry you.<br />
 <br />
                                     FIONA<br />
                         Then why didn't he come rescue me?<br />
 <br />
                         <br />
                                     SHREK<br />
                         Good question. You should ask him that <br />
                         when we get there.<br />
 <br />
                                     FIONA<br />
                         But I have to be rescued by my true <br />
                         love, not by some ogre and his- - his <br />
                         pet.<br />
 <br />
                                     DONKEY<br />
                         Well, so much for noble steed.<br />
<br />
                                     SHREK<br />
                         You're not making my job any easier.<br />
 <br />
                         <br />
                                     FIONA<br />
                         I'm sorry, but your job is not my problem. <br />
                         You can tell Lord Farquaad that if he <br />
                         wants to rescue me properly, I'll be <br />
                         waiting for him right here.<br />
 <br />
                                     SHREK<br />
                         Hey! I'm no one's messenger boy, all <br />
                         right? (ominous) I'm a delivery boy. <br />
                         (he swiftly picks her up and swings <br />
                         her over his shoulder like she was a <br />
                         sack of potatoes)<br />
 <br />
                                     FIONA<br />
                         You wouldn't dare. Put me down!<br />
<br />
                                     SHREK<br />
                         Ya comin', Donkey?<br />
<br />
                                     DONKEY<br />
                         I'm right behind ya.<br />
<br />
                                     FIONA<br />
                         Put me down, or you will suffer the <br />
                         consequences! This is not dignified! <br />
                         Put me down!<br />
 <br />
               WOODS<br />
<br />
               A little time has passed and Fiona has calmed down. She just <br />
               hangs there limply while Shrek carries her.<br />
 <br />
                                     DONKEY<br />
                         Okay, so here's another question. Say <br />
                         there's a woman that digs you, right, <br />
                         but you don't really like her that way. <br />
                         How do you let her down real easy so <br />
                         her feelings aren't hurt, but you don't <br />
                         get burned to a crisp and eaten?<br />
 <br />
                                     FIONA<br />
                         You just tell her she's not your true <br />
                         love. Everyone knows what happens when <br />
                         you find your...(Shrek drops her on <br />
                         the ground) Hey! The sooner we get to <br />
                         DuLoc the better.<br />
 <br />
                                     DONKEY<br />
                         You're gonna love it there, Princess. <br />
                         It's beautiful!<br />
 <br />
                                     FIONA<br />
                         And what of my groom-to-be? Lord Farquaad? <br />
                         What's he like?<br />
 <br />
                                     SHREK<br />
                         Let me put it this way, Princess. Men <br />
                         of Farquaad's stature are in short supply. <br />
                         (he and Donkey laugh)<br />
 <br />
               Shrek then proceeds to splash water onto his face to wash off <br />
               the dust and grime.<br />
 <br />
                                     DONKEY<br />
                         I don't know. There are those who think <br />
                         little of him. (they laugh again) Fiona: <br />
                         Stop it. Stop it, both of you. You're <br />
                         just jealous you can never measure up <br />
                         to a great ruler like Lord Farquaad.<br />
 <br />
                         <br />
                                     SHREK<br />
                         Yeah, well, maybe you're right, Princess. <br />
                         But I'll let you do the "measuring" <br />
                         when you see him tomorrow.<br />
 <br />
                                     FIONA<br />
                         (looks at the setting sun) Tomorrow? <br />
                         It'll take that long? Shouldn't we stop <br />
                         to make camp?<br />
 <br />
                                     SHREK<br />
                         No, that'll take longer. We can keep <br />
                         going.<br />
 <br />
                                     FIONA<br />
                         But there's robbers in the woods.<br />
<br />
                                     DONKEY<br />
                         Whoa! Time out, Shrek! Camp is starting <br />
                         to sound good.<br />
 <br />
                                     SHREK<br />
                         Hey, come on. I'm scarier than anything <br />
                         we're going to see in this forest.<br />
 <br />
                         <br />
                                     FIONA<br />
                         I need to find somewhere to camp now!<br />
 <br />
                         <br />
               Both Donkey and Shrek's ears lower as they shrink away from her.<br />
 <br />
               <br />
               MOUNTAIN CLIFF<br />
<br />
               Shrek has found a cave that appears to be in good order. He shoves <br />
               a stone boulder out of the way to reveal the cave.<br />
 <br />
                                     SHREK<br />
                         Hey! Over here.<br />
<br />
                                     DONKEY<br />
                         Shrek, we can do better than that. I <br />
                         don't think this is fit for a princess.<br />
 <br />
                         <br />
                                     FIONA<br />
                         No, no, it's perfect. It just needs <br />
                         a few homey touches.<br />
 <br />
                                     SHREK<br />
                         Homey touches? Like what? (he hears <br />
                         a tearing noise and looks over at Fiona <br />
                         who has torn the bark off of a tree.)<br />
 <br />
                         <br />
                                     FIONA<br />
                         A door? Well, gentlemen, I bid thee <br />
                         good night. (goes into the cave and <br />
                         puts the bark door up behind her)<br />
 <br />
                         <br />
                                     DONKEY<br />
                         You want me to read you a bedtime story? <br />
                         I will.<br />
 <br />
                                     FIONA<br />
                         (os) I said good night!<br />
<br />
               Shrek looks at Donkey for a second and then goes to move the <br />
               boulder back in front of the entrance to the cave with Fiona <br />
               still inside.<br />
 <br />
                                     DONKEY<br />
                         Shrek, What are you doing?<br />
<br />
                                     SHREK<br />
                         (laughs) I just- - You know - - Oh, <br />
                         come on. I was just kidding.<br />
 <br />
               LATER THAT NIGHT<br />
<br />
               Shrek and Donkey are sitting around a campfire. They are staring <br />
               up into the sky as Shrek points out certain star constellations <br />
               to Donkey.<br />
 <br />
                                     SHREK<br />
                         And, uh, that one, that's Throwback, <br />
                         the only ogre to ever spit over three <br />
                         wheat fields.<br />
 <br />
                                     DONKEY<br />
                         Right. Yeah. Hey, can you tell my future <br />
                         from these stars?<br />
 <br />
                                     SHREK<br />
                         The stars don't tell the future, Donkey. <br />
                         They tell stories. Look, there's Bloodnut, <br />
                         the Flatulent. You can guess what he's <br />
                         famous for.<br />
 <br />
                                     DONKEY<br />
                         I know you're making this up.<br />
<br />
                                     SHREK<br />
                         No, look. There he is, and there's the <br />
                         group of hunters running away from his <br />
                         stench.<br />
 <br />
                                     DONKEY<br />
                         That ain't nothin' but a bunch of little <br />
                         dots.<br />
 <br />
                                     SHREK<br />
                         You know, Donkey, sometimes things are <br />
                         more than they appear. Hmm? Forget it.<br />
 <br />
                         <br />
                                     DONKEY<br />
                         (heaves a big sigh) Hey, Shrek, what <br />
                         we gonna do when we get our swamp anyway?<br />
 <br />
                         <br />
                                     SHREK<br />
                         Our swamp?<br />
<br />
                                     DONKEY<br />
                         You know, when we're through rescuing <br />
                         the princess.<br />
 <br />
                                     SHREK<br />
                         We? Donkey, there's no "we". There's <br />
                         no "our". There's just me and my swamp. <br />
                         The first thing I'm gonna do is build <br />
                         a ten-foot wall around my land.<br />
 <br />
                                     DONKEY<br />
                         You cut me deep, Shrek. You cut me real <br />
                         deep just now. You know what I think? <br />
                         I think this whole wall thing is just <br />
                         a way to keep somebody out.<br />
 <br />
                                     SHREK<br />
                         No, do ya think?<br />
<br />
                                     DONKEY<br />
                         Are you hidin' something?<br />
<br />
                                     SHREK<br />
                         Never mind, Donkey.<br />
<br />
                                     DONKEY<br />
                         Oh, this is another one of those onion <br />
                         things, isn't it?<br />
 <br />
                                     SHREK<br />
                         No, this is one of those drop-it and <br />
                         leave-it alone things.<br />
 <br />
                                     DONKEY<br />
                         Why don't you want to talk about it?<br />
 <br />
                         <br />
                                     SHREK<br />
                         Why do you want to talk about it?<br />
<br />
                                     DONKEY<br />
                         Why are you blocking?<br />
<br />
                                     SHREK<br />
                         I'm not blocking.<br />
<br />
                                     DONKEY<br />
                         Oh, yes, you are.<br />
<br />
                                     SHREK<br />
                         Donkey, I'm warning you.<br />
<br />
                                     DONKEY<br />
                         Who you trying to keep out?<br />
<br />
                                     SHREK<br />
                         Everyone! Okay?<br />
<br />
                                     DONKEY<br />
                         (pause) Oh, now we're gettin' somewhere. <br />
                         (grins)<br />
 <br />
               At this point Fiona pulls the 'door' away from the entrance to <br />
               the cave and peaks out. Neither of the guys see her.<br />
 <br />
                                     SHREK<br />
                         Oh! For the love of Pete! (gets up and <br />
                         walks over to the edge of the cliff <br />
                         and sits down)<br />
 <br />
                                     DONKEY<br />
                         What's your problem? What you got against <br />
                         the whole world anyway?<br />
 <br />
                                     SHREK<br />
                         Look, I'm not the one with the problem, <br />
                         okay? It's the world that seems to have <br />
                         a problem with me. People take one look <br />
                         at me and go. "Aah! Help! Run! A big, <br />
                         stupid, ugly ogre!" They judge me before <br />
                         they even know me. That's why I'm better <br />
                         off alone.<br />
 <br />
                                     DONKEY<br />
                         You know what? When we met, I didn't <br />
                         think you was just a big, stupid, ugly <br />
                         ogre.<br />
 <br />
                                     SHREK<br />
                         Yeah, I know.<br />
<br />
                                     DONKEY<br />
                         So, uh, are there any donkeys up there?<br />
 <br />
                         <br />
                                     SHREK<br />
                         Well, there's, um, Gabby, the Small <br />
                         and Annoying.<br />
 <br />
                                     DONKEY<br />
                         Okay, okay, I see it now. The big shiny <br />
                         one, right there. That one there?<br />
 <br />
                         <br />
               Fiona puts the door back.<br />
<br />
                                     SHREK<br />
                         That's the moon.<br />
<br />
                                     DONKEY<br />
                         Oh, okay.<br />
<br />
               DuLoc - Farquaad's Bedroom<br />
<br />
               The camera pans over a lot of wedding stuff. Soft music plays <br />
               in the background. Farquaad is in bed, watching as the Magic <br />
               Mirror shows him Princess Fiona.<br />
 <br />
                                     FARQUAAD<br />
                         Again, show me again. Mirror, mirror, <br />
                         show her to me. Show me the princess.<br />
 <br />
                         <br />
                                     MIRROR<br />
                         Hmph.<br />
<br />
               The Mirror rewinds and begins to play again from the beginning.<br />
 <br />
               <br />
                                     FARQUAAD<br />
                         Ah. Perfect.<br />
<br />
               Farquaad looks down at his bare chest and pulls the sheet up <br />
               to cover himself as though Fiona could see him as he gazes sheepishly <br />
               at her image in the mirror.<br />
 <br />
               MORNING<br />
<br />
               Fiona walks out of the cave. She glances at Shrek and Donkey <br />
               who are still sleeping. She wanders off into the woods and comes <br />
               across a blue bird. She begins to sing. The bird sings along <br />
               with her. She hits higher and higher notes and the bird struggles <br />
               to keep up with her. Suddenly the pressure of the note is too <br />
               big and the bird explodes. Fiona looks a little sheepish, but <br />
               she eyes the eggs that the bird left behind. Time lapse, Fiona <br />
               is now cooking the eggs for breakfast. Shrek and Donkey are still <br />
               sleeping. Shrek wakes up and looks at Fiona. Donkey's talking <br />
               in his sleep.<br />
 <br />
                                     DONKEY<br />
                         (quietly) Mmm, yeah, you know I like <br />
                         it like that. Come on, baby. I said <br />
                         I like it.<br />
 <br />
                                     SHREK<br />
                         Donkey, wake up. (shakes him)<br />
<br />
                                     DONKEY<br />
                         Huh? What?<br />
<br />
                                     SHREK<br />
                         Wake up.<br />
<br />
                                     DONKEY<br />
                         What? (stretches and yawns)<br />
<br />
                                     FIONA<br />
                         Good morning. Hm, how do you like your <br />
                         eggs?<br />
 <br />
                                     DONKEY<br />
                         Oh, good morning, Princess!<br />
<br />
               Fiona gets up and sets the eggs down in front of them.<br />
<br />
                                     SHREK<br />
                         What's all this about?<br />
<br />
                                     FIONA<br />
                         You know, we kind of got off to a bad <br />
                         start yesterday. I wanted to make it <br />
                         up to you. I mean, after all, you did <br />
                         rescue me.<br />
 <br />
                                     SHREK<br />
                         Uh, thanks.<br />
<br />
               Donkey sniffs the eggs and licks his lips.<br />
<br />
                                     FIONA<br />
                         Well, eat up. We've got a big day ahead <br />
                         of us. (walks off)<br />
 <br />
               LATER<br />
<br />
               They are once again on their way. They are walking through the <br />
               forest. Shrek belches.<br />
 <br />
                                     DONKEY<br />
                         Shrek!<br />
<br />
                                     SHREK<br />
                         What? It's a compliment. Better out <br />
                         than in, I always say. (laughs)<br />
 <br />
                                     DONKEY<br />
                         Well, it's no way to behave in front <br />
                         of a princess.<br />
 <br />
               Fiona belches<br />
<br />
                                     FIONA<br />
                         Thanks.<br />
<br />
                                     DONKEY<br />
                         She's as nasty as you are.<br />
<br />
                                     SHREK<br />
                         (chuckles) You know, you're not exactly <br />
                         what I expected.<br />
 <br />
                                     FIONA<br />
                         Well, maybe you shouldn't judge people <br />
                         before you get to know them.<br />
 <br />
               She smiles and then continues walking, singing softly. Suddenly <br />
               from out of nowhere, a man swings down and swoops Fiona up into <br />
               a tree.<br />
 <br />
                                     ROBIN HOOD<br />
                         La liberte! Hey!<br />
<br />
                                     SHREK<br />
                         Princess!<br />
<br />
                                     FIONA<br />
                         (to Robin Hood) What are you doing?<br />
 <br />
                         <br />
                                     ROBIN HOOD<br />
                         Be still, mon cherie, for I am you savior! <br />
                         And I am rescuing you from this green...(kisses <br />
                         up her arm while Fiona pulls back in <br />
                         disgust)...beast.<br />
 <br />
                                     SHREK<br />
                         Hey! That's my princess! Go find you <br />
                         own!<br />
 <br />
                                     ROBIN HOOD<br />
                         Please, monster! Can't you see I'm a <br />
                         little busy here?<br />
 <br />
                                     FIONA<br />
                         (getting fed up) Look, pal, I don't <br />
                         know who you think you are!<br />
 <br />
                                     ROBIN HOOD<br />
                         Oh! Of course! Oh, how rude. Please <br />
                         let me introduce myself. Oh, Merry Men. <br />
                         (laughs)<br />
 <br />
               Suddenly an accordion begins to play and the Merry men pop out <br />
               from the bushes. They begin to sing Robin's theme song.<br />
 <br />
                                     MERRY MEN<br />
                         Ta, dah, dah, dah, whoo.<br />
<br />
                                     ROBIN HOOD<br />
                         I steal from the rich and give to the <br />
                         needy.<br />
 <br />
                                     MERRY MEN<br />
                         He takes a wee percentage,<br />
<br />
                                     ROBIN HOOD<br />
                         But I'm not greedy. I rescue pretty <br />
                         damsels, man, I'm good.<br />
 <br />
                                     MERRY MEN<br />
                         What a guy, Monsieur Hood.<br />
<br />
                                     ROBIN HOOD<br />
                         Break it down. I like an honest fight <br />
                         and a saucy little maid...<br />
 <br />
                                     MERRY MEN<br />
                         What he's basically saying is he likes <br />
                         to get...<br />
 <br />
                                     ROBIN HOOD<br />
                         Paid. So...When an ogre in the bush <br />
                         grabs a lady by the tush. That's bad.<br />
 <br />
                         <br />
                                     MERRY MEN<br />
                         That's bad.<br />
<br />
                                     ROBIN HOOD<br />
                         When a beauty's with a beast it makes <br />
                         me awfully mad.<br />
 <br />
                                     MERRY MEN<br />
                         He's mad, he's really, really mad.<br />
 <br />
                         <br />
                                     ROBIN HOOD<br />
                         I'll take my blade and ram it through <br />
                         your heart, keep your eyes on me, boys <br />
                         'cause I'm about to start...<br />
 <br />
               There is a grunt as Fiona swings down from the tree limb and <br />
               knocks Robin Hood unconscious.<br />
 <br />
                                     FIONA<br />
                         Man, that was annoying!<br />
<br />
               Shrek looks at her in admiration.<br />
<br />
                                     MERRY MAN<br />
                         Oh, you little- - (shoots an arrow at <br />
                         Fiona but she ducks out of the way)<br />
 <br />
                         <br />
               The arrow flies toward Donkey who jumps into Shrek's arms to <br />
               get out of the way. The arrow proceeds to just bounce off a tree.<br />
 <br />
               <br />
               Another fight sequence begins and Fiona gives a karate yell and <br />
               then proceeds to beat the crap out of the Merry Men. There is <br />
               a very interesting 'Matrix' moment here when Fiona pauses in <br />
               mid-air to fix her hair. Finally all of the Merry Men are down, <br />
               and Fiona begins walking away.<br />
 <br />
                                     FIONA<br />
                         Uh, shall we?<br />
<br />
                                     SHREK<br />
                         Hold the phone. (drops Donkey and begins <br />
                         walking after Fiona) Oh! Whoa, whoa, <br />
                         whoa. Hold on now. Where did that come <br />
                         from?<br />
 <br />
                                     FIONA<br />
                         What?<br />
<br />
                                     SHREK<br />
                         That! Back there. That was amazing! <br />
                         Where did you learn that?<br />
 <br />
                                     FIONA<br />
                         Well...(laughs) when one lives alone, <br />
                         uh, one has to learn these things in <br />
                         case there's a...(gasps and points) <br />
                         there's an arrow in your butt!<br />
 <br />
                                     SHREK<br />
                         What? (turns and looks) Oh, would you <br />
                         look at that? (he goes to pull it out <br />
                         but flinches because it's tender)<br />
 <br />
                         <br />
                                     FIONA<br />
                         Oh, no. This is all my fault. I'm so <br />
                         sorry.<br />
 <br />
                                     DONKEY<br />
                         (walking up) Why? What's wrong?<br />
<br />
                                     FIONA<br />
                         Shrek's hurt.<br />
<br />
                                     DONKEY<br />
                         Shrek's hurt. Shrek's hurt? Oh, no, <br />
                         Shrek's gonna die.<br />
 <br />
                                     SHREK<br />
                         Donkey, I'm okay.<br />
<br />
                                     DONKEY<br />
                         You can't do this to me, Shrek. I'm <br />
                         too young for you to die. Keep you legs <br />
                         elevated. Turn your head and cough. <br />
                         Does anyone know the Heimlich?<br />
 <br />
                                     FIONA<br />
                         Donkey! Calm down. If you want to help <br />
                         Shrek, run into the woods and find me <br />
                         a blue flower with red thorns.<br />
 <br />
                                     DONKEY<br />
                         Blue flower, red thorns. Okay, I'm on <br />
                         it. Blue flower, red thorns. Don't die <br />
                         Shrek. If you see a long tunnel, stay <br />
                         away from the light!<br />
 <br />
                                     SHREK &amp; FIONA<br />
                         Donkey!<br />
<br />
                                     DONKEY<br />
                         Oh, yeah. Right. Blue flower, red thorns. <br />
                         (runs off)<br />
 <br />
                                     SHREK<br />
                         What are the flowers for?<br />
<br />
                                     FIONA<br />
                         (like it's obvious) For getting rid <br />
                         of Donkey.<br />
 <br />
                                     SHREK<br />
                         Ah.<br />
<br />
                                     FIONA<br />
                         Now you hold still, and I'll yank this <br />
                         thing out. (gives the arrow a little <br />
                         pull)<br />
 <br />
                                     SHREK<br />
                         (jumps away) Ow! Hey! Easy with the <br />
                         yankin'.<br />
 <br />
               As they continue to talk Fiona keeps going after the arrow and <br />
               Shrek keeps dodging her hands.<br />
 <br />
                                     FIONA<br />
                         I'm sorry, but it has to come out.<br />
 <br />
                         <br />
                                     SHREK<br />
                         No, it's tender.<br />
<br />
                                     FIONA<br />
                         Now, hold on.<br />
                         (chuckles) I was hoping this would be <br />
                         a happy ending.<br />
 <br />
               Shrek and Fiona kiss...and the kiss fades into...<br />
<br />
               THE SWAMP<br />
<br />
               ...their wedding kiss. Shrek and Fiona are now married. 'I'm <br />
               a Believer' by Smashmouth is played in the background. Shrek <br />
               and Fiona break apart and run through the crowd to their awaiting <br />
               carriage. Which is made of a giant onion. Fiona tosses her bouquet <br />
               which both Cinderella and Snow White try to catch. But they end <br />
               up getting into a cat fight and so the dragon catches the bouquet <br />
               instead. The Gingerbread man has been mended somewhat and now <br />
               has one leg and walks with a candy cane cane. Shrek and Fiona <br />
               walk off as the rest of the guests party and Donkey takes over <br />
               singing the song.<br />
 <br />
                                     GINGERBREAD MAN<br />
                         God bless us, every one.<br />
<br />
                                     DONKEY<br />
                         (as he's done singing and we fade to <br />
                         black) Oh, that's funny. Oh. Oh. I can't <br />
                         breathe. I can't breathe.<br />
 <br />
               THE END

I would't say its high effort, it didn't took a long time either as half of the hud is basically m0rehud. But yeah I would say I got kinda carried away while doing it since It was a funny and pretty stupid project.

							Somebody once told me that comp is gonna roll me, i'm better of in creators.tf instead<br />
I thought that sounds really dumb, surely comp is much more fun<br />
so i queue, thoughts of medals in my head<br />
Well, the salt starts coming and it don't stop coming<br />
matched against froyotech, no point in running<br />
telling myself that i play for fun,<br />
but if you don't heal i'm freaking done<br />
If you don't switch i'll throw this game<br />
i don't care if spy is your main<br />
i swear i'll pick pyro on attack<br />
then uninstall, never look back<br />
Hey now, you're merc 3, <br />
pick your main, and go play<br />
hey now, got to rank up, <br />
got to earn that cool stage
